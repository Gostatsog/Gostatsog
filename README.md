## Hi there, my name is Gustavo Medina, Student of Universidad Austral de Chile in the IngenierÃ­a Civil InformÃ¡tica carreer. ðŸ‘‹

## You can find me in...

* gustavo.medina@alumnos.uach.cl
* gustavomedina512@gmail.com
* Other social media as Gostatsog (Yes, a somewhat disappointing name... but nobody would want to steal it from me (big pp)).

## All my repositories are part of my years of studying at UACH, plus a project in 14K as part of my first internship. (those last ones I can't make public for obvious reasons)

## That's all for me, have a day!!
